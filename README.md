Hi, my name is Logan and I have been coding for 5 years now, 3 years on my own and in a bootcamp through DevMountain and 2 years professionally.  I currently build and maintain software for public defender attorneys.  The main languages I work with at my job are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, T SQL and C#.  I do have experience with React and Node.js as well.
